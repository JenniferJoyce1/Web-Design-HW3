    <h1>Homework 6</h1>
    <p> In this homework I created a database for an event planner. There is a table for events, and attendees. 
        The guest table connects a plus ones to an attendee. The RSVP table connects the attendees to a specific event. 
        Specifically for HW6 I added a chart tab</p>
